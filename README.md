Chess
=====

Chess will be a JavaScript library to help build chess programs.  Eventually, it should understand
the rules of chess, Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), Short Algebraic Notation (SAN), and the basics
of Portable Game Notation (PGN).

 This is the third time I have written a chess library.  The first one was in Ruby, but it was too
 slow, and the next was in C.  It is very fast, and I also created a Ruby gem, so it could be used
 easily from Ruby programs.  There's really nothing wrong with the C implementation... but I'd like
 to try a strictly JavaScript version for use both in browsers and Node.js apps, and writing
 JavaScript is always fun!
